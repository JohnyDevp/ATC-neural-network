### Training of BetterNN, 100 epochs

-   **model**: model_betterNN_epoch_100.pth, model_betterNN_400epochs.pth
    ![Alt text](res/betterNN_100epochs_trainblue_testorange_loss.png)
-   model doesn't show any improvement after 400 epochs, though there is slight trend of learning (guessing from loss function), the heavy outliers still occurs, no matter of how long it is trained
-   also the shape tends to go straight, no progress can be seen from picture (from values as mentioned before there is visible some future...)
